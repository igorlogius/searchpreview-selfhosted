1.   (Addon) Bing and Yahoo seem to be non functional at the moment, not sure why (Needs investigation) 
1. (Backend) Real database for image caching (maybe sqlite, but a dedicated maria or postgres DB might be bettein the long term )
1. (Backend) Cache invalidation + update mechanic (if we use a real db ... this could also be handled by a DB macro)
